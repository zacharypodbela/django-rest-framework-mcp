- YOU SHOULD NEVER BE WRITING CODE TO ANY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY TREE (THIS FOLDER OR ITS SUBUFOLDERS). These files were copied to the project to make it easier for you (Claude) to READ the source code of the frameworks and dependencies that are most integral to building django-rest-framework-mcp. Writing to these files will do NOTHING.
- If the folders in this directory are empty, run `git pull --recurse-submodules` to pull in the source code.
