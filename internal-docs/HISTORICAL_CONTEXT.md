# Q: Why are we not using the python-sdk MCP package to build our MCP server?

## Current Implementation (Manual JSON-RPC)

**What we're doing:**

- Manual JSON-RPC parsing in `MCPView.post()`
- Manual protocol handling (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`)
- Manual error response formatting
- Custom tool execution logic
- \~160 lines of protocol implementation

## MCP Python SDK Approach

**What the SDK provides:**

- `FastMCP` class handles all JSON-RPC protocol details
- Built-in `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `initialize` handling
- Automatic schema generation from function signatures
- Built-in error handling and response formatting
- ASGI/HTTP transport layers included

## Analysis

**Pro: Yes, using the SDK would reduce re-implementation**

### 1. Protocol Layer (\~80 lines saved):

- No manual JSON-RPC parsing
- No manual `initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call` handlers
- Automatic error response formatting

### 2. Schema Generation (\~50+ lines in `schema.py` could be simplified):

- SDK auto-generates schemas from function signatures
- Current DRF-to-JSON-Schema conversion could be replaced

### 3. Transport Layer:

- Built-in HTTP handling via `StreamableHTTPSessionManager`
- Current Django view â†’ could become a simple adapter

## ðŸš§ BUT, Con: Doing so would greatly increase Django integration complexity

### 1. The deleted `server.py` was attempting this approach:

- Used `FastMCP` + `StreamableHTTPSessionManager`
- Required complex ASGI â†” Django adapters (`_call_starlette_handler`)
- Became more complex than manual implementation

### 2. Core Challenge â€“ ViewSet Integration:

- SDK expects functions like `async def my_tool(param1: str):`
- We need to bridge: **SDK Tool Function â†’ DRF ViewSet.action**
- Current `MCPToolExecutor` would still be needed

### 3. Django-specific Features:

- Request context (`request.is_mcp_request`)
- DRF permissions, authentication, throttling
- Django's native HTTP handling vs ASGI

## Final Answer

The SDK could reduce **\~30â€“40% of code** (protocol handling),
but the **core complexity would remain** (DRF integration).

The current approach is actually quite elegant because:

1. **Simple & Django-native** â€“ Uses Django views directly
2. **No impedance mismatch** â€“ No ASGI â†” Django conversion needed
3. **Full DRF integration** â€“ Easy to add permissions, auth, etc.
4. **Debuggable** â€“ Standard Django request/response cycle

> The SDK approach was actually tried (the deleted `server.py`) but abandoned because the Django integration complexity outweighed the protocol simplification benefits.

# Q: Why do we require developers to pass in an input serializer classes for custom actions?

## The Problem We Encountered

We initially tried to generalize schema generation by automatically detecting body input needed by the endpoint by inspecting serializer fields for writeable (non-read-only) fields. However, this approach failed because business logic determines data requirements, not serializer definitions.

A custom action might need completely different fields than what's in the ViewSet's main serializer:

```python
@action(detail=False, methods=['post'])
def generate(self, request):
    user_prompt = request.data['user_prompt']
    llm_response = call_llm(user_prompt)
    return Response({'llm_response': llm_response})
```

Even for CRUD endpoints, the relationship between serializers and actual data usage is loose - A ViewSet might override the default implementation of a CRUD action to use something different than what's in the serializer:

```python
def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    if request.data.get('send_email_on_create'):
        send_email()

    return super().create(request, *args, **kwargs)
```

## Our Architectural Decision

We decided to extend the existing @mcp_tool decorator to accept a serializer parameter that lets developers explicitly declare input requirements. It is required for custom actions and optional for default CRUD actions. This approach makes sense because:

- Integrates cleanly with existing decorator architecture
- Only the developer knows what their business logic actually needs - we can't guess it from static analysis of serializer definitions alone.
- We need a full Serializer class as opposed to just a dictionary representing the schema b/c the dictionaries don't provide enough context to fill out the description, format, etc. which is essential for good LLM performance.

# Q: Why do MCP tool input schemas have top-level keys like 'body' and 'kwargs'?

## The Problem: Multiple Input Sources in DRF ViewSets

Django REST Framework ViewSet actions can receive data from multiple sources:

- **Request body** (`request.data`) - JSON payload data
- **URL path parameters** (`kwargs`) - Like `pk` for detail views, `lookup_field` values
- **Query parameters** (`request.query_params`) - URL query string parameters [future]
- **Headers** (`request.headers`) - HTTP headers [future]

Each source serves a different purpose and gets passed to ViewSet methods differently.

## Our Architectural Decision: Explicit Top-Level Keys

We structured MCP tool input schemas with explicit top-level keys that map directly to these input sources:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "customer_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "kwargs": {
    "pk": "123"
  }
}
```

**Key Mapping:**

- `body` â†’ `request.data` (request body/payload)
- `kwargs` â†’ direct parameters to ViewSet action methods
- `query_params` â†’ `request.query_params` [planned future feature]
- `headers` â†’ `request.headers` [planned future feature]

## Why This Design?

**Simplicity.** Each input source can have its own logic for generating schemas, and when a request comes in it's dead simple to unpack the values and pass them to ViewSets correctly.

With explicit top-level keys, the request handling becomes straightforward:

```python
# Clean unpacking
body_data = mcp_request.get('body', {})
kwargs_data = mcp_request.get('kwargs', {})

# Direct assignment
request.data = body_data
viewset_action(request, **kwargs_data)
```

## Alternative Considered: Flat Schema

We considered a flat schema where all parameters are at the top level:

```json
{
  "customer_name": "John Doe", // body
  "email": "john@example.com", // body
  "pk": "123" // kwargs
}
```

**Rejected because:**

- Have to leverage the functions that generated the schema to understand which parameters go where
- Parameter name conflicts between sources
- Less maintainable as input sources grow

# Q: Why are we reimplementing the DRF lifecycle (dispatch) in execute_tool?

## The Problem: We need to abide by DRF interface contracts

Initially, we were bypassing DRF's request lifecycle entirely - directly calling ViewSet action methods with raw Django HttpRequest objects. This broke DRF's contracts:

1. Actions expect `rest_framework.requests.Request` objects, not Django's HttpRequest
2. authentication, permissions, throttles, versioning, content_negotiation were being skipped
3. Custom `initial()`, `initialize_request()`, `handle_exception()`, or `finalize_response()` logic was bypassed

That being said, some parts of the lifecycle doesn't make sense for MCP:

- Content negotiation and Renderers aren't relevant since MCP/JSON-RPC dictates the input and output format.
- Processing headers for incoming requests / adding headers to responses

## Our Architectural Decision: A differentiated version of dispatch built for MCP

Replicate what `dispatch()` does -- specialized for MCP, but keeping as much of the lifecycle contract developers have come to expect as possible to minimize compatibility issues and unexpected behavior.

Parts of the lifecycle that will be run:

- `initial` will be run. If your view does not override this function or calls `super().initial`, this will include running `perform_authentication`, `check_permissions`, `check_throttles`, and `determine_version`. While `perform_content_negotiation` would also be run, the `Request` object will not have `negotiator` or `parsers` set (so this function should do nothing).

Parts of the lifecycle that will be skipped:

- `initialize_request` will not be run. We will create a `rest_framework.requests.Request` from the `django.http.HttpRequest`, but not using this handler.
- `finalize_response` will not be run.
- `handle_exception` will not be run in the event of an exception\*.
- (If your view overrides `dispatch`, keep in mind this function will also not run.)

- **\*NOTE:** It's hard to say whether `handle_exception` should or shouldn't be leveraged for MCP requests as it has a lot to do with what the developer is using that handler for. If developers are formatting the error response, we wouldn't want this to run (b/c the protocols define how errors should be formatted). If developers are running logging or business logic, ideally we would want this to run. For now, we're not going to run it, but if we encounter a lot of feedback from developers who need it to run, we can make this a configurable setting that defaults to `False`.

### Differences in Request properties

As a consequence of the `django.http.HttpRequest` and `rest_framework.requests.Request` not being initialized via an incoming API call, it will be missing several API specific properties including `method`, `path`, and `path_info`.

## Why This Design?

- No need to work backwards into "faking" the HTTP methods, which added complexity and makes it much harder to understand what's actually going on.
- In the future we can further customize the lifecycle for MCP-specific needs. Ex: skip content negotiation since MCP/JSON-RPC dictates the output format.

### Acknowledged Downsides

- In future versions of DRF, if the implementation of `dispatch` is changed and the contract between the framework and the `APIView` methods changes, we'll need to update our implementation to match.
- By skipping the parts of the lifecycle that aren't relevant to MCP, we may be skipping logic that developers are relying on to run in order for the view actions to function properly. This might mean some more unconventional or complex use cases won't be supported to start or developers will need to put in extra effort to re-work their ViewSets to be compatible with our framework.

## Alternative Considered: Just pass the request into the ViewSet's dispatch

Call `viewset_class.as_view({'post': 'create'})` and fake the HTTP method to match what the action expects. Then let the ViewSet handle the request _as if_ it was an APIRequest.
