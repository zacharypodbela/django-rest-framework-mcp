- In this directory I've copied important documentation that is readily available online to an offline format to make it easy for you (Claude) to reference.

* `/django-rest-framework-api`: This is the API docs for the django-rest-framework. It is useful because we are building a framework who's goal is to enable quickly spinning up an MCP Server to go alongside a set of django rest framework APIs. It was copied from https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ on 8/8/2025.
* `/mcp-protocol`: This is the full documentation on the Model Context Protocol specification. Since we are building an MCP Server it must conform to these specs. It was copied from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/ on 8/8/2025.
* `/json-rpc.md`: The JSON-RPC 2.0 specification that underlies the MCP protocol's transport layer. Essential reference for understanding the request/response format, error handling, and batch operations that MCP is built on top of.
